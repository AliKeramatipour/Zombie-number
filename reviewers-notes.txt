Dear reviewers Thank you for taking the time to review our paper and special thanks for your helpful comments and
suggestions for improving this paper. In response to your suggestions, we have outlined the changes and provided the
necessary explanations.


Reviewer #1:
    Two new results was added to paper.

    On minor comments: 
    
    P1 L39) In cop-version, as explained in new paper, cops can choose any edge and move along it or either save their
    current position, while zombies must always get closer to survivor. 
    
    P1 L43) We changed the statement to "Minimum number of zombies needed to capture the survivor no matter what sort of moves
    survivor makes".

    P1 L45 and 48, P2 FIG1, P1 L31, P4 L17, P4 L18) changed.

Reviewer #2:
    Our proof was not so clear and was not understood correctly. G-zombies will move along H-edges if possible. They prioritize
    H-moves over G-moves. Our strategy makes them share the same G subgraph. Now if one can do an H-move, they will all
    do the same.
    
    On minor comments:

    P1 L49, FIG1 and FIG2) changed.
    
    P3 L53) When survivor does an H-move, its H subgraph wont change. This means, H-zombies will follow their path and get to
    the survivor's H-subgraph (H_x).

    P3 L54) After at most n H-moves done by "survivor", not "H-zombies". H-zombies will keep doing G-moves as said. They prefer
    doing G-moves and since they are not in the same H-subgraph with survivor, they can do a G-move.

Reviewer #3:
    We really appreciate your comments and help to improve results and paper. I considered capture time, and a new
    problem popped into my mind. What if we needed the zombie player to win in 1,2,3,...k move ? Can we determine the
    minimum number of zombies needed for this problem ? This question might be useful since in zombie's original
    problem, there was no limitation. This version can be useful in applied networks and other fields as well. Solving
    this problem in case k = 1, is like finding a dominating set and belongs to NP-Hard. Using the dominating set idea i
    got from k = 1, i proved for k's bigger than 1, problem also belongs to NP-Hard.

    Your notes on explaining my proof was really useful. I changed most of the parts and i think now its much more clear.

    On writing suggestions:

    1) changed.

    2) I tried my best to to avoid this as much as possible. I think the paper is now much more readable.

    3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10) changed. 

    Mathematical suggestions:

    P2 L18) added. We also changed vertex labels.

    P2 L22) changed.

    P2 L33) removed the second definition.

    P2 L35) changed.

    P2 L41) changed lemma 1. I wanted to prove, for the shortest path between each two vertices, there is a equivalent for
    that path which uses G-edges before H-edges or vice-versa.

    P3 L25) changed figure 2.

    P3 L29) changed.

    P3 L30) removed.

    P3 L34) A lot of parts where changed. I think the straegy is now more precise and clear.

Reviewer #4:
    Lemma 1) Lemma 1 was changed on the new version. Altough it's not a hard problem, but i think stating it before the
    actual proof is useful for a better understanding.

    Note or Paper) We did submit this as a "note" instead of "paper". We also added two more new results in the new
    version.
