Reviewer #1:
    Three new results was added to paper.

    On minor comments: 
    
    1) In cop-version, as explained in new paper, cops can choose any edge and move along it or either save their
    current position, while zombies must always get closer to survivor. 
    
    2) We changed the statement to "Minimum number of zombies needed to capture the survivor no matter what sort of moves
    he makes".

    3,4,5,6,7) changed.

Reviewer #2:
    Our proof was not so clear and was not understood. G-zombies will move along H-edges if possible. They prioritize
    H-moves over G-moves. Our strategy makes them share the same G subgraph. Now if one can do an H-move, they will all
    do the same.
    
    On minor comments:

    1,2) changed.
    
    3) When survivor does an H-move, its H subgraph wont change. This means, H-zombies will follow their
    path and get to survivor's H-subgraph (H_x).

    4) After at most n H-moves done by survivor, not H-zombies. H-zombies will keep doing G-moves as said. They prefer
    doing G-moves and since they are not in the same H-subgraph with survivor, they can do a G-move.

Reviewer #3:
    We really appreciate your comments and help to improve results and paper. I considered capture time, and a new
    problem popped into my mind. What if we needed the zombie player to win in 1,2,3,...k move ? Can we determine the
    minimum number of zombies needed for this problem ? This question might be useful since in zombie's original
    problem, there was no limitation. This version can be useful in applied networks and other fields as well. Solving
    this problem in case k = 1, is like finding a dominating set and belongs to NP-Hard. Using the dominating set idea i
    got from k = 1, i proved for k's bigger than 1, problem also belongs to NP-Hard which lead to proof of original
    zombie number problem to belong to NP-Hard. I think its already proven that cop number problem is NP-Hard, but this
    idea and proof, i believe is simple and can be applied to cop number problem as well.

    Your notes on explaining my proof was really useful. I changed a lot of parts. I think i made myself more clear.

    Other minor problems was changed as well. We referred to vertices as (i,j) instead of V_{i,j} as you suggested.
