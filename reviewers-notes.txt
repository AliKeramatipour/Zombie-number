Dear reviewers, thank you for your time to review our paper and special thanks for your helpful comments and suggestions
for improving this paper. In response to your suggestions, we have outlined the changes and provided the necessary
explanations.


Reviewer #1:
    Three new results was added to paper.

    On minor comments: 
    
    -- p.1, line 39:  "as in cop-version cops should not"  [this doesn't make sense]:

        -> In cop-version, as explained in the new paper, cops can choose any edge and move along it or either save
        their current position, while zombies must always get closer to the survivor. 

    -- p.1, line 43:  "player always has a winning strategy" [do the zombies exactly have a 'strategy'?  They follow a
    simple algorithm, so it's unclear to the reader; it's also unclear what move the zombies make when faced with
    multiple shortest paths]:

        -> By having a winning strategy, we meant zombie player can always win no matter how survivors
        moves. We changed the statement in the new revised version

    -- p.1, line 45 and line 48 The word "the" should precede "Cartesian product"
    -- p.2, Figure 1: the figure is a little confusing given the numbers of the vertices in H (I assume it was copied from an example illustrating a colouring or independent set?, but given the preceding paragraph referring to indexed vertices, it could be confusing.)
    -- p.3, line 31: the word "the" should precede "zombie number"
    -- p.4, line 17: subscript on Z(Q_2)
    -- p.4, line 18: the word "Cartesian" is capitalized elsewhere in the proof. 
        
        -> Thanks for your comments, we have changed these in the new version.

Reviewer #2:
    Our proof was not so clear and it also had some issues regarding coordinates of the cartesian product vertices. We
    changed it in the new version.
    
    On your first comment: 
        -> G-zombies will move along H-edges (HG-path as in previous version) if possible. They prioritize H-moves over
        G-moves. Our strategy makes them share the same G-subgraph. Now if one can do an H-move, they will all do the
        same.
    
    On minor comments:

    -- P1 L49.  $G \Box H$ is defined on vertex set $V(G) \times V(H)$.  Hence by fixing $u$ in the pair $(u,v)$ it is a
    copy of $H$, not a copy of $G$, that is obtained.  Likewise, fixing $v$ yields a copy of $G$, not $H$.
    -- Figure 1 shows $G \Box H$ with the copies of $G$ taking vertical form.  But in Figure 2 they are shown horizontally.
    I recommend using a consistent portrayal.

        -> Thanks for your comments, we have changed these in the new version.

    -- P3 L53.  Although the distance between the two stated vertices is at most $n$, the survivor is not guaranteed to be
    stationary.  So it is unclear that $H_y$ can be reached within $n$ $H$-moves.

        -> Our proof was unclear here. We changed it and also added a new figure in appendix for further understanding.
        We are sorry for this mistake, by H_y we meant H_x since the survivor's H-subgraph would be H_x.
        When survivor does an H-move, its H subgraph wont change. This means, H-zombies will follow their path and
        get to the survivor's H-subgraph (H_x). So after at most n(or diameter of graph G) H-moves by survivor, H-zombies
        will be in H_x. From now on, for each G-move made by survivor, they will mimic it so they would still be in H_x. For
        each H-move made by survivor, H-zombies will play the game just like they would on a single H graph. Since they can
        win on H, survivor cannot do unlimited H-moves.

    -- P3 L54.  The authors state that by making $H$-moves the $H$-Zombies will reach $H_y$.  But if they are making
    $H$-moves, then these zombies are staying within their current copy of $H$. 

        -> This statement was also unclear. We meant after at most n H-moves done by survivor , and not H-zombies.
    
Reviewer #3:
    We really appreciate the time you have put and your comments to help improving this paper. This new paper was not
    possible without your comments.

    On writing suggestions:

    -- P1 L25: “We also use the proved conjecture to provide a new proof for Z(Q n ) = ⌈ 2n/3 ⌉ ” could be written more
    eﬃciently as something like “This result provides a new proof for Z(Q n ) = ⌈ 2n/3 ⌉ ” In general there are many
    places where the writing could be tighter, and such changes would result in a more readable manuscript. I suggest
    the authors go through the paper looking for such places (Phrases like “We can now see that” can be repaced by
    “thus” for example.)

        -> Thank you for your suggestion. We went through the paper and looked for such places. We believe
        it is much more readable now.

    -- Other comments from P1 L17, P1 L33, P1 L36, P1 L40, P1 L45, P1 L48, P4 L17, P4 L19

        -> Thanks for your comments, we have changed these in the new version.

    Mathematical suggestions:

    -- On comments from P2 L18, P2 L33, P2 L35, P3 L25, P3 L29, P3 L30
        
        -> Thanks for your comments, we have changed these in the new version.

    -- P2 L22: I think it is more standard to use z for zombie number rather than Z.

        -> We used a different "z" for zombie number in the new version. Also "Z" is now used for the zombie number
        problem.
    
    -- P2 L41: Lemma 1 is not used in the rest of the paper and should be deleted. IF it turns out to be useful, my
    comments about it are below. 

        -> We removed the lemma completely. We added another lemma which is not really complicated but we believe its
        needed for understanding and to show that the moves made by zombies are possible.

    -- P3 L34:

        -> We really appreciate your comments. In the new version, we used a fixed path (p_G and p_H) for the zombies
        to follow. The statement "G-Zombies will move on an HG-path" is not true since the H-part of the HG-path needs to be
        unique. Otherwise G-zombies might lose their arrangement and will not be able to follow their strategy when they
        reach G_y. But by having a unique path, this will not be a problem.

    Suggestions for extension:

        -> Thanks for your suggestions. By thinking about capture time and bounding it in our strategy, a new variation of the
        zombies and survivors game regarding capture time was added as well. This new problem is like the original game but
        zombie player must win in limited number of moves. We prove this new problem and original version of the game
        belongs to NP-Hard class of problems.


Reviewer #4:
    -- On lemma 1: 
    
        -> Lemma 1 was changed on the new version. Although it's not a hard problem, but we believe stating it before
        the actual proof is useful for a better understanding.

    -- Submitting:

        -> We did submit this as a "note" instead of "paper". We also added two more new results in the new version.
