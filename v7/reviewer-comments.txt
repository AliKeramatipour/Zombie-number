Dear reviewers, thank you for your time to review our paper and special thanks for your helpful comments and suggestions
for improving this paper. In response to your suggestions, we have outlined the changes and provided the necessary
explanations.


Reviewer #1:
    -- P1 L19: I am not sure why you use italics in various spots in the abstract

        -> We changed the usage in the new version, we only use it for new terms in our paper.

    -- p.1, line 43:  "player always has a winning strategy" [do the zombies exactly have a 'strategy'?  They follow a
    simple algorithm, so it's unclear to the reader; it's also unclear what move the zombies make when faced with
    multiple shortest paths]:

        -> By having a winning strategy, we meant zombie player can always win no matter how survivors
        moves. We changed the statement in the new revised version

    -- P1 L47: “cops should not” should be “cops need not”
    -- P1 L48: “They can either hold...” should be its own sentence.
    -- p.3, line 31: the word "the" should precede "zombie number"
    -- p.4, line 17: subscript on Z(Q_2)
    -- p.4, line 18: the word "Cartesian" is capitalized elsewhere in the proof. 
        
        -> Thanks for your comments, we have changed these in the new version.

Reviewer #2:
    Our proof was not so clear and it also had some issues regarding coordinates of the cartesian product vertices. We
    changed it in the new version.
    
    -- I think that I have found some flaws in the proof given in the current manuscript.  Most importantly, the premise
    stated on P3 L39 that "Since $G$-Zombies are initially on the same $G_i$ after each move they would still be on the
    same $G_i$" is, I believe, false.  To describe a situation that illustrates that this statement is false, suppose
    that there are 3 $G$-Zombies, located on three distinct vertices, say $u, v, w$ of some $G_i$.  By virtue of being
    $G$-Zombies, these three zombies will move within $G_i$ before choosing to move along an $H$-edge.  However, suppose
    that the survivor is located in the same copy of $H$ as vertex $v$.  Then the zombie at $v$ will now move along an
    $H$-edge, whereas the zombies at $u$ and $w$ will move along $G$-edges.  $u,v,w$ will now fail to be in the same
    copy of $G$, contrary to what the authors have stated in their proof.
        
        -> G-zombies will move along H-edges (HG-path as in previous version) if possible. They prioritize H-moves over
        G-moves. Our strategy makes them share the same G-subgraph. Now if one can do an H-move, they will all do the
        same.
    
    On minor comments:

    -- P1 L49.  $G \Box H$ is defined on vertex set $V(G) \times V(H)$.  Hence by fixing $u$ in the pair $(u,v)$ it is a
    copy of $H$, not a copy of $G$, that is obtained.  Likewise, fixing $v$ yields a copy of $G$, not $H$.
    -- Figure 1 shows $G \Box H$ with the copies of $G$ taking vertical form.  But in Figure 2 they are shown horizontally.
    I recommend using a consistent portrayal.

        -> Thanks for your comments, we have changed these in the new version.

    -- P3 L53.  Although the distance between the two stated vertices is at most $n$, the survivor is not guaranteed to be
    stationary.  So it is unclear that $H_y$ can be reached within $n$ $H$-moves.

        -> Our proof was unclear here. We changed it and also added a new figure in appendix for further understanding.
        We are sorry for this mistake, by H_y we meant H_x since the survivor's H-subgraph would be H_x.
        When survivor does an H-move, its H subgraph wont change. This means, H-zombies will follow their path and
        get to the survivor's H-subgraph (H_x). So after at most n(or diameter of graph G) H-moves by survivor, H-zombies
        will be in H_x. From now on, for each G-move made by survivor, they will mimic it so they would still be in H_x. For
        each H-move made by survivor, H-zombies will play the game just like they would on a single H graph. Since they can
        win on H, survivor cannot do unlimited H-moves.

    -- P3 L54.  The authors state that by making $H$-moves the $H$-Zombies will reach $H_y$.  But if they are making
    $H$-moves, then these zombies are staying within their current copy of $H$. 

        -> This statement was also unclear. We meant after at most n H-moves done by survivor , and not H-zombies.
    
Reviewer #3:
    We really appreciate the time you have put and your comments to help improving this paper. This new paper was not
    possible without your comments.

    On writing suggestions:

    -- P1 L25: “We also use the proved conjecture to provide a new proof for Z(Q n ) = ⌈ 2n/3 ⌉ ” could be written more
    eﬃciently as something like “This result provides a new proof for Z(Q n ) = ⌈ 2n/3 ⌉ ” In general there are many
    places where the writing could be tighter, and such changes would result in a more readable manuscript. I suggest
    the authors go through the paper looking for such places (Phrases like “We can now see that” can be repaced by
    “thus” for example.)

        -> Thank you for your suggestion. We went through the paper and looked for such places. We believe
        it is much more readable now.

    -- P1 L17: “The Zombies and Survivors” should be “Zombies and Survivors”
    -- P1 L33: “The Zombies and Survivor game” should be “The Zombies and Survivors game”
    -- P1 L36: “Starting by” should be “Starting with”
    -- P1 L45: “Cartesian product” should be “The Cartesian product”
    -- P1 L48: “Cartesian product” should be “the Cartesian product”
    -- P4 L17: Z ( Q 2 ) should be Z(Q 2 ) (parenthesis should not be subscript).
    -- P4 L19: “proved conjecture” should be “Theorem 2”

        -> Thanks for your comments, we have changed these in the new version.


    -- P1 L40: “cop-version” should be “Cops and Robbers” ( I would also advise referring to the Cop game as “Cops and
    Robbers” throughout, rather then sometimes as “Cops and Robber”)

        -> Since we are considering the game with one zombie, we referred to this game as "Cops and Robber". In the new
        version we changed it to "Cops and Robber(s)".

    Mathematical suggestions:

    -- P2 L18: You could add to the caption that this is the Cartesian product GH = C 3 C4  of G = C 3 and H = C 4 . The
    vertex labels do not seem to have a purpose and should be removed (or made consistent with the notation used in the
    paper).
    -- P2 L33: You already deﬁned G i and H j on Page 1 so you should not repeat the deﬁnition here.
    -- P2 L35: I would suggest adopting the convention that the vertices of G and H are numbered and just referring to
    the vertex (i, j) rather than V i,j (the V doesn’t add any information).
    -- P3 L25: In Figure 2, H and G do not necessarily have the same number of vertices, so there should not be n copies
    of each.
    -- P3 L29: “Conjecture 2” should be “Theorem 2”
    -- P3 L30: The sentence before the proof does not add anything and should be removed.
    
        -> Thanks for your comments, we have changed these in the new version.

    -- P2 L22: I think it is more standard to use z for zombie number rather than Z.

        -> We used a different "z" for zombie number in the new version. Also "Z" is now used for the zombie number
        problem.
    
    -- P2 L41: Lemma 1 is not used in the rest of the paper and should be deleted. IF it turns out to be useful, my
    comments about it are below. 

        -> We removed the lemma completely. We added another lemma which is not really complicated but we believe its
        needed for understanding and to show that the moves made by zombies are possible.

    -- P3 L34: There are a number of issues with the proof. The main one is that the zombie strategy is not precisely
    deﬁned. Given a survivor vertex and a set of zombie vertices, the exact move made by each zombie must be clearly
    speciﬁed. Below I propose a way to make your idea a precise strategy. Since the strategy is not precisely deﬁned, it
    also makes the proof of correctness diﬃcult. But once you specify the strategy precisely, you need to verify that
    every move that the zombies make is legal, and brings them closer to their goal. One way to do this would be to
    introduce notation for the current G i for the G-zombies and the survivor (E.g. G z and G s , and similar for
    H-zombies), and note that until either the G-zombies are in the same G i as the survivor or the H zombies are in the
    same H j as the survivor that the distance in H edges from G s to G z plus the distance in G edges from H s to H z
    strictly decreases after each move. Then once G s = G z (or H s = H z ) you can use a more precise argument that the
    robber will only be able to make a ﬁnite number of moves on G-edges (or H-edges). Once G s = G z and H s = H z the
    robber can pnly make a ﬁnite a number of moves of any kind before being caught. Here is a proposal for one way to
    make your strategy precise. First you would deﬁne what it means for zombies to start in a winning position (can
    catch the survivor no matter where they are), or to be in a winning position relative to the survivor’s current
    position, and specify that the G-zombies begin in a winning position on one of the G i ’s and the H-zombies begin in
    a winning position for one of the H j. Suppose the survivor is at (x, y). Then on their turn, if the G-zombies are
    in G i , and i = ̸ y, all G-zombies should move to the same G j , where j is one step closer to y in H than i. If i
    = y, then the G-zombies should play their winning strategy on G i (Note in the proof of correctness, you need to
    argue why following this strategy keeps the G-zombies in a Gwinning position–this is a subtle point, and the reason
    is because they do not start playing their strategy on G until they are in the same G i as the survivor, at which
    point they are in a winning position (because their ﬁrst coordinates have not changed). From that point on, every
    time the survivor makes a G move, the G-zombies counter with their winning strategy on G, thus maintaining their
    winning position. You can specify the strategy (and justiﬁcation) for H the same way.

        -> We really appreciate your comments. In the new version, we used a fixed path (p_G and p_H) for the zombies
        to follow. The statement "G-Zombies will move on an HG-path" is not true since the H-part of the HG-path needs to be
        unique. Otherwise G-zombies might lose their arrangement and will not be able to follow their strategy when they
        reach G_y. But by having a unique path, this will not be a problem.

    Suggestions for extension:

        -> Thanks for your suggestions. By thinking about capture time and bounding it in our strategy, a new variation of the
        zombies and survivors game regarding capture time was added as well. This new problem is like the original game but
        zombie player must win in limited number of moves. We prove this new problem and original version of the game
        belongs to NP-Hard class of problems.


Reviewer #4:
    -- On lemma 1: 
    
        -> Lemma 1 was changed on the new version. Although it's not a hard problem, but we believe stating it before
        the actual proof is useful for a better understanding.

    -- Submitting:

        -> We did submit this as a "note" instead of "paper". We also added two more new results in the new version.
