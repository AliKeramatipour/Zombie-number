\section{Introduction}\label{section-introduction}

The {\it Zombies and Survivor} game is played on a simple connected graph by two players. The deterministic version of
this game \cite{Fitz16} is played as follows. Initially, the zombie player is given $\mathpzc{z}$ zombies and places
them on the graph's vertices. Then the survivor player chooses one single vertex which is the survivor's initial
position. Starting with the zombie player and having turns alternating, on each player's turn, the zombie player must
move each zombie to one of its adjacent vertices so that they get closer to the survivor, while the survivor player
either moves to an adjacent vertex or stays at his current location. Here lies the difference between {\it Zombies and
Survivor} and {\it Cops and Robber(s)} games, as in {\it Cops and Robber(s)} cops need not necessarily get closer to the
robber(s). They can either hold their current position, get closer, or further away from the robber(s). Although zombies
are not as intelligent as cops, they can still choose their path intelligently between the shortest paths. If any zombie
and the survivor ever occupy the same vertex, the survivor is captured and the zombie player wins. The zombie number of
a graph $G$, denoted as $\zn(G)$, is the minimum number of zombies required so that the zombie player can always capture
the survivor, no matter how survivor moves. Since zombies' moves are restricted, the initial arrangement that the zombie
player chooses is essential for him to win.

The Cartesian product $G \sq H$ of two graphs $G$ and $H$, is a graph with vertex set $V(G) \times V(H)$, where
vertices $(u_1 , u_2)$ and $(v_1 , v_2)$ are adjacent if and only if $u_1 = v_1$ and $ \{ u_2 , v_2 \} \in E_{H} $, or
$u_2 = v_2$ and $ \{u_1 , v_1 \} \in E_{G}$ \cite{West02}. Figure \ref{fig:p2} shows an example of the Cartesian product
of two graphs.

{\it Capture time} of a game \cite{Bonato09}, noted as $capt(G,\mathpzc{z})$, represents the maximum number of moves
that the survivor can avoid being caught on a graph $G$, while the zombie player tries to catch the survivor as quickly
as possible using $\mathpzc{z}$ zombies. If the survivor can win, $capt(G,\mathpzc{z})$ is infinite.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:

1) In \cite{Fitz16}, Fitzpatrick et al. conjectured that $\zn(G \sq H) \leq \zn(G) + \zn(H)$. In Section \ref{conj-proof}, we prove this conjecture and
use it to show that $\zn(Q_n) = \ceil*{\frac{2n}{3}}$. 

2) The complexity of the {\it Cops and Robber(s)} game is known \cite{Fomin10} \cite{Kinnersley15}. In Section \ref{np-zombienumber},
we prove that the original {\it Zombies and Survivor} game belongs to NP-Hard class of problems.

3) In Section \ref{capturetime}, we provide a new bound on {\it capture time} of {\it Zombies and Survivor} game played on the Cartesian
product of two graphs. 

4) In Section \ref{np-capturetime}, we introduce a variation of {\it Zombies and Survivor} game, in which the zombie
player is restricted to win in a limited number of moves, and prove it belongs to NP-Hard class of problems.




\section{Zombie number of the Cartesian product of two graphs}\label{conj-proof}

To prove $\zn(G \sq H) \leq \zn(G) + \zn(H)$, we show that $\zn(G) + \zn(H)$ zombies are enough for the zombie player to
capture the survivor on $G \sq H$.

To explain the proof we first need to define some notation. Assume $H$ and $G$ have $m$ and $n$ vertices,
respectively. 

For $1 \leq i \leq m$, define $G_i$ to be the subgraph of $G \sq H$ induced by vertices $(u,v = i)$. Similarly, for $1 \leq j \leq
n$, define $H_{j}$ to be the subgraph of $G \sq H$ induced by vertices $(u = j,v)$.

In the Cartesian product of $G$ and $H$, each $G_{i}$ $(1 \leq i \leq m)$ is isomorphic to $G$, and each $H_{j}$ $(1
\leq j \leq n)$ is isomorphic to $H$. Also the common vertex between $G_{i}$ and $H_{j}$ is $(j,i)$. Figure \ref{fig:p1}
illustrates these definitions.

A {\it G-edge} is an edge in one of the $G_{i}$s and an {\it H-edge} is an edge in one of the $H_{j}$s. A {\it G-move}
is a move made on a {\it G-edge}. Similarly, an {\it H-move} is a move made on an {\it H-edge}. If the survivor decides
to remain in its current vertex, this move is considered both a {\it G-move} and an {\it H-move}. 

Denote $dist_I(j,k)$ to be the distance between vertices $j$ and $k$ on a graph $I$. Denote the length of a path $P$ to be $len(P)$. 

For vertex $(u,v)$, define its $G$-equivalent vertex to be vertex $u \in G$, and its $H$-equivalent vertex, to be vertex
$v \in H$. $G$-equivalent graph is a graph $G$ where each zombie and the survivor is put on its $G$-equivalent vertex.
$H$-equivalent graph is defined in the same way.


\begin{figure}[h!]
	
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{cp3.png}
	\caption{$G \sqSmall H$, $G_i$s, and $H_i$s.}
	\label{fig:p1}
\end{figure}


We start off by stating a simple lemma regarding distance in Cartesian product:
\begin{lemma} \label{shortestpathlemma}
	$dist_{G \sqSmall H}((x,y),(u,v)) = dist_G(x,u) + dist_H(y,v)$.
\end{lemma}


\begin{theorem}
	\label{T2}
	$\zn(G \sq H) \leq \zn(G) + \zn(H)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	We provide a winning strategy for the Cartesian product of $G$ and $H$ using $\zn(G)+\zn(H)$ zombies. First, we place
	$\zn(G)$ zombies, that have a winning strategy on a single $G$, $G_{a = 1}$ and call them {\it G-zombie}s. We do the
	same for $H_{b = 1}$ and call them {\it H-zombie}s. Also $(x,y)$ is the survivor's vertex.


	Consider one of the shortest paths between vertices $a$ (the index of $G$-subgraph shared by {\it G-zombie}s) and
	$y$ in $H$ and call it $p_H$. We also define $p_G$ in the same manner between $b$ and $x$.


	On each zombie turn, if $a \neq y$, each {\it G-zombie} will move along the $p_H$ path in its corresponding $H$
	subgraph. According to Lemma \ref{shortestpathlemma}, since zombies' and the survivor's equivalents on $H$ are
	getting closer, thus their actual vertices on $G \sq H$ are getting closer as well and this move is possible. Since
	they are all moving along similar paths (in their corresponding $H$-subgraphs) they will still share the same
	$G$-subgraph. Now consider when $a = y$, {\it G-zombie}s will play their winning strategy (that they had on a single
	$G$) in this case. This move is also possible since in $G$'s strategy, zombies would get closer to the survivor on
	each turn. This means for those turns that $a=y$ holds, if we consider the $G$-equivalent graph between {\it
	G-zombie}s and the survivor, it is just like a simple game played on a single $G$. {\it H-zombie}s will follow the
	same strategy but in their corresponding environment.
	
	
	Suppose using this strategy the survivor wins, therefore the survivor must be able to do either infinite {\it
	G-move}s or infinite {\it H-move}s. Without loss of generality, suppose the survivor makes infinite {\it H-move}s.
	After $len(p_G)$ number of {\it H-move}s, {\it H-zombie}s will get to $H_x$. Now for each {\it G-move} made by the
	survivor and having zombies mimicking it, they will still be on $H_x$. Since the survivor can do infinite number of {\it
	H-move}s and not be caught, it means that the survivor could also avoid being caught on a single $H$ which
	contradicts our assumption.
	
\end{proof}
An example for further understanding can be found in supplementary materials of this paper.

\begin{corollary}
	\label{C3}
	$\zn(Q_{n}) \leq \ceil*{\frac{2n}{3}}$
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	We prove this by using both induction and Theorem \ref{T2}. First note that the Cartesian product of
	hypercube graphs $Q_{m}$ and $Q_{n}$ is equal to $Q_{m+n}$. It is easy to see $\zn(Q_3) = 2$, $\zn(Q_2) = 2$, and
	$\zn(Q_1) = 1$. For $n > 3$, we consider $Q_n$ as the Cartesian product of $Q_3$ and $Q_{n-3}$. Using the induction
	base, we know that $\zn(Q_{n-3}) \leq \ceil*{\frac{2n - 6}{3}}$. According to Theorem \ref{T2}, $\zn(Q_n) \leq
	\zn(Q_{n-3}) + \zn(Q_3)$ and $\zn(Q_{n-3}) \leq \ceil*{\frac{2n - 6}{3}} = \ceil*{\frac{2n}{3}} - 2$, we can see that
	$\zn(Q_n) \leq \ceil*{\frac{2n}{3}}$.
\end{proof}

It is already proved that at least $\ceil*{\frac{2n}{3}}$ zombies are needed to capture one survivor on graph $Q_n$
(Theorem 16 of \cite{Fitz16}):

\begin{theorem}
	\label{T4}
	For each integer $n \geq 1$, $\zn(Q_n) \geq \ceil*{\frac{2n}{3}} $.
\end{theorem}

Combining Corollary \ref{C3} and Theorem \ref{T4} we can conclude that $\zn(Q_n) = \ceil*{\frac{2n}{3}}$.
This proves Conjecture 18 from \cite{Fitz16} which is already proved in \cite{Offner19} and \cite{Fitz18} with different methods. 

\section{Zombie Number Problem is NP-Hard}\label{np-zombienumber}
	Now define zombie number ($\NPZ$) problem:
	{\newline}
	INSTANCE: A simple undirected graph $G = (V,E)$ and a positive integer $\mathpzc{z}$.
	{\newline}
	QUESTION: Is $\zn (G) \leq \mathpzc{z}$?

	\begin{theorem}
		$\NPZ \in$ NP-Hard class.
	\end{theorem}
	\begin{proof}
		We reduce the dominating-set problem to $\NPZ$.

		To do this, we add $n = |V(G)|$ copies of $K_{n,n}$ to $G$. We call the newly obtained graph $H$, and call the
		$G$-subgraph simply $G$, and the $i$-th $(1 \leq i \leq n)$ bipartite subgraph as $B_i$. $(i,j,b)$ represents
		the $j$-th vertex in $B_i$'s part $b$ ($b = 1,2$) and labels $1,2,..,n$ represent $G$'s vertices. For each
		vertex $(i,j,b)$ we connect it to vertices in $N_G[j]$ (See figure \ref{fig:p8}). We are adding $2n^2$ new
		vertices, and building $H$ can be done in polynomial time.

		\begin{figure}[h!]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{sec5.png}
			\caption{$H$ obtained from $P_4$, zombie player needs at least $\gamma(P_4) = 2$ zombies to win}
			\label{fig:p8}
		\end{figure}

		By having zombies on each vertex of $G$'s dominating-set, the survivor will be captured on the first move and zombie
		player wins. Thus, $\zn(H) \leq \gamma(G)$. Now suppose we have zombies less than the domination number of
		graph: $\mathpzc{z} < \gamma(G)$. We prove the survivor can avoid being captured.
		
		Since there are $n$ bipartite subgraphs, one of them, say $B_k$, is initially free of zombies. Further, since
		the zombies do not dominate $G$, there will be a vertex $w \in V (G)$ not adjacent to a zombie. Thus the
		survivor can safely start at vertex $(k,v = w,b = 1)$ (let $(k,v,b)$ denote the survivor's vertex).

		Zombies in $G$ (e.g. at vertex $u$) are at distance 2 from the survivor $(u \rightarrow (k,u,3 - b) \rightarrow
		(k,v,b))$, which means after their move all of them should be at one of $(k,v,b)$'s neighbors, that is, $N_G[v]
		$ or, $ (k,1 \leq i \leq n,3 - b)$. Therefore, each zombie joining $B_k$ does not share the same part of
		$B_k$ as the survivor, since it has to be on one of its neighbors.
		
		On each survivor turn, assume that the survivor is at $(k,v,b)$ and zombies are either in $G$, or in $B_{(i \neq
		k)}$, or in $B_k$ at a vertex of the form $(k,j,3-b)$ (not in the same part as the survivor). Since there is a
		vertex $w \in G$ not dominated by zombies, the survivor should move to vertex $(k,w,3-b)$. Since the survivor
		now shares the same part as all zombies in $B_k$, and there are no zombies in $N_G[w]$, none of his neighbors is
		occupied by a zombie, so the survivor can safely follow this strategy indefinitely.

		It is now proved that $\zn(H) = \gamma(G)$, thus the dominating-set problem is reduced to $\NPZ$.

	\end{proof}

\section{Capture time in Cartesian product of graphs}\label{capturetime} 

	The eccentricity of a vertex $v$ is the greatest distance between $v$ and any other vertex. The radius of a graph is the
	minimum eccentricity of its vertices. Given a graph $G$, let $rad(G)$ denote its radius.
	\begin{theorem}
		\label{T5}
		$capt( G \sq H, z_G + z_H ) < rad(G) + rad(H) + capt(G, z_G) + capt(H, z_H)$
	\end{theorem}
	\begin{proof}
		By using $z_G$ zombies as {\it G-zombie}s and $z_H$ zombies as {\it H-zombie}s, and having them follow the same
		set of moves provided in Theorem \ref{T2}, with the difference that initially $a$ and $b$ are centers of graphs
		$H$ and $G$. We show that the survivor's {\it G-move}s cannot exceed $rad(H) + capt(G, z_G)$. With the same
		conclusion, it can be shown that {\it H-move}s cannot exceed $rad(G) + capt(H, z_H)$ as well.

		According to the definition of the radius of a graph, after at most $rad(H)$ {\it G-move}s by the survivor, $a =
		y$ holds. Then for each {\it G-move} made by the survivor, the {\it G-zombie}s follow their strategy on the $G$
		graph to capture the survivor in at most $capt(G,z_G)$ additional moves.
		
		Since each of the survivor's moves is either a {\it G-move} or an {\it H-move} or both, after less than $rad(G)
		+ rad(H) + capt(G, z_G) + capt(H, z_H)$ moves the survivor will be captured.
	\end{proof}
\section{Limited capture time zombie number problem is NP-Hard}\label{np-capturetime} 

	A well known example of an NP-hard problem is the dominating-set problem in graph theory\cite{Hopcroft07}. A
	dominating-set for a graph $G$ is a subset $D$ of $V(G)$ such that every vertex not in $D$ is adjacent to at least
	one member of $D$. The domination number $\gamma(G)$ is the number of vertices in the smallest dominating-set for
	$G$.

	We define $Lc\zn(G,k)$ ({\it limited capture time zombie number}) as the minimum number of zombies needed so that
	zombie player is able to capture the survivor in at most $k$ moves on graph $G$. 

	Let $N_G[u]$ represent the closed neighborhood of $u$ in graph $G$.
	
	The $LC\NPZ_k$ problem is defined as below:
	{\newline}
	INSTANCE: A simple undirected graph $G = (V,E)$ and a positive integer $\mathpzc{z}$.
	{\newline}
	QUESTION: Is $Lc\zn(G,k) \leq \mathpzc{z}$ ?
	{\newline}
	{\newline}
	The dominating-set problem is defined below:
	{\newline}
	INSTANCE: A simple undirected graph $G = (V,E)$ and a positive integer $d$.
	{\newline}
	QUESTION: Is $\gamma(G) \leq d$ ?

	\begin{theorem}
		$LC\NPZ_k$ $\in$ NP-Hard
	\end{theorem}
	\begin{proof}
		We prove this by reducing the dominating-set problem to $LC\NPZ_k$ in polynomial time.

		Consider $k$ to be an arbitrary positive integer. We construct a new graph $G'_k$ from $G$. Suppose $G$ has $n$
		vertices. For each $v \in V(G)$, we add $k-1$ new vertices $(v,1 \leq i < k)$ making a new path,
		$(v,(v,1),(v,2),...,(v,k-1))$ (as shown in figure \ref{fig:p7}). Creating $G'_k$ can be done in polynomial time.

		\begin{figure}[h!]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{LCZ.png}
			\caption{$G'_k$ obtained from $G = C_5$ where for $k = 1,2,3$}
			\label{fig:p7}
		\end{figure}		


		We prove this theorem by showing $Lc\zn(G'_k,k) = \gamma(G)$. Suppose the set of vertices $S'$ of $G'_k$ are a
		choice of initial vertices for the zombies which allow them to capture the survivor within $k$ moves. Let $S$ be
		the set of vertices $v \in V(G)$ such that $v \in S'$ or $(v,i) \in S'$. If there is a vertex $u \in V(G)$ not
		dominated by $S$, then there is no vertex $v$ such that $v \in S'$ and $v \in N_{G'_k}[u] \cup \{(u,i): 1 \leq i
		< k\}$. By having the survivor in vertex $(u, k-1)$, there is no zombie at distance $k$ or less from him, which
		means he will not be captured. Thus $\gamma(G) \leq Lc\zn(G'_k,k)$ holds.
		
		Now for each vertex $v$ in one of $G$'s smallest dominating-sets, place a zombie on vertex $v$ of $G'_k$. These
		zombies can capture the survivor in at most $k$ moves. To show this, consider the survivor's initial vertex, if it
		is not a newly added vertex, he can be captured in one move. Now suppose the survivor is initially on $(u,i)$. Since
		$u$ is dominated by a zombie, after zombies' first move, the survivor will be trapped inside the $u$'s path, and would
		be captured in at most $k$ moves. Therefore, $Lc\zn(G'_k,k) \leq \gamma(G)$.

		By combining these results, $Lc\zn(G'_k,k) = \gamma(G)$. Therefore the dominating-set problem is reduced to
		$LC\NPZ_k$.

	\end{proof}
